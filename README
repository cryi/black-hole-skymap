black hole raytrace simulator

raytraces relativistic phenomena such as black holes and Alcubierre warp drive bubbles

does so by iterating the 4D rays of light through geodesics of arbitrary geometry.

black hole geometry is calculated via Schwarzschild metric expanded to Cartesian coordinates.
schwarzschild metric

Alcubierre warp drive bubble was already provided in Cartesian.  Way to go ADM formalism!
